# 🎥 Natural Grounding TikTok Video Manager



## 🌿 Background

Natural Grounding is a practice by Rion Williams (2007) - the idea is simple: immersive, repeated viewing of women with authentic, uninhibited feminine energy recalibrates your attraction baseline away from the manufactured Western standard.

### 🧘 How it works

You sit down, put on a playlist of curated videos, and just watch - relaxed, no agenda. No analysis, no overthinking. You let the energy of naturally feminine women sink in. Over time this builds a real internal reference point for what genuine femininity looks and feels like, which most Western men have never had. The result is that you feel better, more grounded, less reactive to social games - and women notice.

Williams originally used Thai pop VCDs for this. **TikTok is the modern equivalent** - millions of short clips, many from East and Southeast Asian creators, where that same unfiltered natural energy still surfaces constantly. The challenge is finding and curating it efficiently. That's what this tool does.

### 📊 Content Categories

Williams rated his resources with a simple system: `N` for natural energy, `SB` for Silver Bullet (highest impact), and `E` for Entertainment - enjoyable but mixed energy, not pure grounding material.

This project maps that to TikTok. The **E3** classification directly corresponds to Williams' E3 the vault high energy state numen enlightment resonanz trigger.
